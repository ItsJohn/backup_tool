# Backup Tool
This tool allows the user to select files and folders to backup to the location where the program is stored. It is currently a work in progress.

To run the program: `python3 gui.py`

These are the features to come to:
* Get the copy files method to adjust the last_modified field in the JSON
* Add an ignore files button
* Get the progress bar to work
* Add a feature to choose the backup location (search for last part of path if not found)
